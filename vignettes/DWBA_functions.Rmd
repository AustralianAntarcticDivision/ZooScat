#### Getting the orientation angles
  
If no orientaiton angle should be computed on ly the mean orientation will be considered (`para$orient$angm`).  

If an average orientation should be computed (`para$orient$ave_flag = 1`), either a Uniform (`para$orient$PDF = 1`) or a Gaussian (`para$orient$PDF = 2`) probability density function (PDF) can be applied.  

In case of a Uniform PDF the limits are defined by minimum ($\theta_{min}=$ `para$orient$ang0`) and maximum ( $\theta_{max}=$ `para$orient$ang1`) orientation angles and the mean incident angle ( $\bar\theta =$ `para$orient$angm`).  

For a Gaussian PDF, the limits are defined as $\bar\theta \pm std(\theta)$ (`para$orient$angm` $\pm$ `para$orient$PDF_para`).

The angles for which the model should be computed are then optained as the sequence of values within the limits of the minimum and maximum orientation angles by the incremental step (`para$orient$dang`).

Within ZooScat the orientations are added to the misc list as `misc$ang`for further use in the DWBA funciton.  

### Getting the limits of the ka variation

First the width of the radius of the mid-point of each cylinder ($a$) is obtained through combinaiton of information on the target Length ($L$) and the ratio $\frac{L}{a}$.  

The next step is to get the initial and final ka (the wavenumber ($k$, which equals the 2$\pi$ divided by the wavelength ($\lambda=c/f$ with $c$ = soundspeed [m/s] and $f$ the frequency [Hz])), multiplied by the radius): $ka = 2\pi \frac{f}{c_w}a = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}a$ (in ZooScat this equals `k(c,f)*a` or `2*pi*a/lambda(c,f)`).  

If the output model variable is frequency (`para$simu$var_indx=1`), the range of ka depends on the maximum (`para$simu$var1`) and minimum input (`para$simu$var0`) frequencies. If the output variable is angles (`para$simu$var_indx=2`), only the simulation frequency will be considered (`para$simu$freq`). If the output variable is ka (`para$simu$var_indx=3`) the the limits of ka are directly defined through the variable start and end values (`para$simu$var0`, `para$simu$var1`).  
  
In ZooScat, ka values are stored in the misc list for further use in the DWBA simulation (`misc$ka`)  

### DWBA simulation parameters
Get the number of ka points ($n$): `length(misc$ka`  
Number of integration points ($n_{int}$): `para$simu$ni`  
Initial ka ($ka_0$): `misc$ka`  
Incident angles ($ang$): `misc$ang`  
Number of incident angles($m$): `length(misc$ang`  
Incident angles in radians ($th$): `ang*pi/180`  
  

### Material properties  

----Inhomogenous body-----

If a homogenous body is assumed, density ($g$) and soundspeed ($h$) contrasts are directly read from the parameters and stored as a matrix with dimensions [$n_{int}$ rows x 1 column] (`g = para$phy$g0 * matrix(1, n_int, g); h = para$phy$h0 * matrix(1, n_int, h)`).  

In a next step the DWBA material properties term $C_b = \gamma_k - \gamma_{\rho} = \frac{1-gh^2}{gh^2} - \frac{g-1}{g}$ is computed (`Cb = (1-g*h*h)/(g*h*h) - (g-1) / g`)  

### Position vectors  

Position vectors are computed using the `buildpos` function.

Reading form a file:
A small offset for the interpolation is defiend (`eps=2^-52`).  

The coordinates are read from a file (`pos`) as: `xp = pos[,1]; zp = pos[,2]; taper1 = pos[,3]` and then the coordinates are calculated for the requested number of integration points ($n_{int}$). For $z$ the sequence with length $n_{int}$ between the minimum and maximum points $zp$ are computed (` z = seq(min(zp) + eps, max(zp)-eps, length=n_int)`). Points $x$ and $tapering$ are opbtained through one-dimensional linear interpolation between the points $zp$ and $xp$ or $taper$ at points $z$ (`approx(zp,xp,z, method="linear")`; `approx(zp,taper1,z, method="linear")`).  
Then the points are normalised byt theire mean (`x = x-mean(x); z=z-mean(z)`).  
The 2D-distance between the points is computed through $d_r =\sqrt{(x_n-x_{n+1})^2+(y_n+y_{n+1})^2}$ (`dr=sqrt(diff(x)^2 + diff(z)^2)`)  
The length equals $L=\sum{dr}$ (`sum(dr)`)
 

### Computing final output value  

The backscattering amplifude $f$ relates to the output variable in the following way, where $y = |f|$ :  

- Normalised Backscattering amplitude: $f_{norm}=\frac{f}{L}$
- Scattering pressure: $p_{scat} = p_0(\frac{e^{ikr}}{r})f$  
- Backscattering cross-section: $\sigma_{bs} = |f|^2$ 
- TS: $10log_{10}(\sigma_{bs})$ (here transformation from mm into m has to be done)  
- Reduced Target Strength RTS: $10log_{10}(\frac{\sigma_{bs}}{L^2})$
