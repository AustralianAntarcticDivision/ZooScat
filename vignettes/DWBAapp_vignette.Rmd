## The DWBA app vignette and prerequisites
This vignette is a guide to the DWBA [shiny web application](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) `DWBAapp()`. The DWBAapp() has been specifically designed, to easily and quickly create ZooScat config files, and visualise the DWBA output of singular simulations. The availability of config files allows for quick and easy parametrisation of [one single core]("DwbaCommand.html") or [multiple parallelised DWBA simulations](Parallelise DWBA sweeps.html). More information on the DWBA model can be found in [this vignette]("DwbaCommand.html") and a validation of the model, comparing outcomes to an analytical model can be found in [this vignette]("CompareToAnalyticalSolution.html"). 

The `DWBAapp()` function is included in the ZooScat package and depends on:  

* [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) - to build the shiny app [@shiny]
* [shinyjs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinyjs/index.html) - for some features like  showing/hiding tabs inside the shiny app [@shinyjs]
* [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) - for nicer plots [@ggplot]
* [reshape2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html) - for easy reshaping of datframes to be plotted in ggplot2 [@reshape2]
* [pracma](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pracma/index.html) - for some Matlab-like mathematical operations [@pracma]  

The `ZooScat` package has to be loaded into R:

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(ZooScat)
```

## Starting the app  
The easiest way to start the application is through:

```{r eval=FALSE}
DWBAapp()
```

This will launch an R preview window with the app. It is recommended to open the app in an independent browser such as [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).  

![*DWBAapp on startup, with the parameters pane on the left and the results pane on the right*](appStart.png){width=700px}

### Opening in a browser  
Opening the app in a separate browser window can be achieved either though clicking Open in Browser in the R preview pane or by opening a ne browser Window and pasting the address and port at which the app is running. Running `DWBAapp()` will provide the address and port as `Listening on http://127.0.0.1:7411` where the address should correspond to the localhost and the last four digits represent the port. 

### Running a first model  
Clicking the Run Model button will run a DWBA model for a uniformly bent cylinder with generic shape, orientation, material and simulation settings.  

![*Results of initial model run*](initial_run.png){width=400px align=centre}  

## General app concept  
The app is composed of two main panes:  
The settings pane (left), where all model parameters can be set. Four different types of model input parameters an be defined:  

1. Shape
2. Orientation
3. Orientation
4. Simulation  

![*Shape tabe of the settings pane*](shape_pane.png){width=200px align=centre}  

The second pane is the results pane (right) where the model outputs will be shown or can be exported as csv file and where general config files can be loaded or the current settings be saved as config file. A detailed description of the config files can be found in the config file section of this vignette.  
  
![*Results pane with the initial model run*](res_pane.png){width=200px align=centre}  
   
The quickest way to run a specific model is through loading a configuration file into the app. All settings can then be adjusted through the app. Once the right settings have been set the config file can be saved for future use. If no config file is available, all settings can be adjusted from scratch.  

To load a config file, hit the borwse button under `Load Parameter Configuration` within the `Results Tab` of the Results pane.  

![*Top part of the results pane, where config files can be loaded or saved, the model can be run and the results can be exported as csv file*](load_config.png){width=400px align=centre}  

  
#### Getting additional information on the model input variables  
Clicking on any of the input titles will open a little popup window in the lower right corner of the screen with some information on the selected variable. These popups are colour coded with blue = information, yellow = warning, red = error. Warnings will for example appear if the density or soundspeed contrast are set beyond the recommended limits.  

![*Information popup for the shape profile option*](shape_prof_info.png){width=150px align=centre}


A list of all parameters, the respective name in the app and the model code, the meaning, the unit and the influence on the model are explained in the table of the Parameter Explanation tab within the result pane.

![*First entries of the parameter explanation table*](para_ex.png){width=600px align=centre}


### The results plots  
The first plot in the result pane shows the shape for which the model was run (generated by the `buildpos(para)` function), defined by the shape settings.  
The second plot represents the model output, dependent on all the model parameters (generated by `bscat(para, misc)` function.  

#### Getting values from the result plot  
Moving the mouse over the second plot will display the current position of the mouse, the closest y-axis value and the euclidean distance to this value from the current mouse position.  

![*Plot values closest to mouse cursor*](result_mover.png){width=200px align=center}

#### Zooming into the result plot  
Holding the left mouse button allows the drawing of a zoom box on the result plot. Double-clicking into the box will zoom into the selected area. This step can be repeated indefinetely. Double clicking into the plot without a box will zoom out back to to full plot extend.  

![*Zoom into results plot*](zoom.png){width=700px align=center}

### The results table  
The results table shows the model outcome values.  
The number of displayed items per page can be changed by changing the value of the `Show ... Entries` SelectBox at the top left corner of the table.  
The table can be searched for any values in the search box.  
The table can be sorted in increasing or decreasing order for the values of a given column by clicking on the column header.  
The table values can be exported as comma-separated (csv) file by clicking the Export as csv button on top of the results page. This will open a file input menu where the output folder and filename can be set.

## The config file

### Config file template  

Config file can be created outside of the app or be edited using a standard text editor. It is important though to keep the original format.  
The code below is an example config file, which corresponds to the `config1.dat` in the package config example data folder (*`r paste0(system.file(package="ZooScat"),"/extdata/configs/")`*):  

```

#### Shape profile files  
Shape profile files are loaded into the `buildpos` function and generate a shape in combination with the other shape settings.  
Shape profiles must contain at least three columns without headers, describing the X, Z coordinates and the radius R. Two additional columns, describing the upper and lower extend of the cylinder can be included.  
The following is a minimal example, describing a generic krill:  

```
0.0000	38.3500	0.0000
0.9149	36.8563	0.2147
1.7924	34.0464	0.6525

#### Calculating soundspeed in water

Ambient soundspeed (c) is an import input into the model. Basic parameters, such as wavelength dependt directly on c. In combinaiton with the soundspeed contrast (ratio between the soundspeed inside and outside the scattering target), the soundspeed inside the target can be calculated. This underlines the importance of having good estimates of soundspeed contrast for similar targets at similar ambient conditions.  

Inside DWBAapp, c can be computed by clicking on the `Calculate c based on Salinity, Temperature and Depth` link on the `Material properties` tab (located under the Ambient Soundspped input). This will open a new tab in the result pane.

Three different methods of calculating ambient soundspeed are currently implementd in ZooScat:  

* Coppens 1981 [@coppens_simple_1981] (`c_Coppens1981`)  
Calculates speed of sound in seawater based on Coppens (1981) The empirical equation generally holds validity for a temperature range between 0 and 35 degrees Celsius, Salinities between 0 and 45 parts per thousand and a depth range between 0 and 4000 m. This empirical formula takes three input values (Depth (D) in m, Salinity (S) in ppt and Temperature (T) in degrees Celsius:

$$t = T/10; D = D/1000 $$
$$c_0 = 1449.05 + 45.7t - 5.21 t^2 + 0.23 t^3 + (1.333 - 0.126 t + 0.009 t^2) (S - 35) $$
$$c = c_0 + (16.23 + 0.253t) D + (0.213 - 0.1t) * D^2 + (0.016 + 2e^{-04} (S - 35)) (S - 35)tD$$  

* Mackenzie 1981 [@mackenzie_nine-term_1981] (`c_Mackenzie1981`)  
Calculate speed of sound in seawater based on MacKenzie (1981) The empirical equation generally holds validity for a temperature range between 2 and 30 degrees Celsius, Salinities between 25 and 40 parts per thousand and a depth range between 0 and 8000 m. This empirical formula takes three input values (Depth (D) in m, Salinity (S) in ppt and Temperature (T) in degrees Celsius: 

$$1448.96 + 4.591 T - 5.304 10^{-2} T^2 + 2.374 *10^{-4} T^3 +\\ 
1.34 (S - 35) + 1.63 * 10^{-2}D + 1.675 * 10{^-7} D^2 - \\
1.025 * 10^{-2} T (S -35)-7.139 * 10^{-13}  T  D^3$$

* LeRoy 2008 [@leroy_new_2008] (`c_Leroy08`)  
Returns the sound speed according to Leroy et al (2008). This "newer" equation should solve the sound speed within 0.2 m/s for all seas, including the Baltic and Black sea, based on Temperature, Salinity and Latitude. Exceptions are some seas with anomalities close to the bottom. The equation was specifically designed to be used in marine acoustics. This empirical formula takes three input values (Depth (D) in m, Salinity (S) in ppt, Temperature (T) in degrees Celsius, and Latitude (lat) in degrees:

$$ 1402.5 + 5 T - 5.44 * 10^{-2} T^2 + 2.1 * 10^{-4} T^3 + 1.33 S -\\ 
        1.23 * 10^{-2} S T + 8.7 * 10^{-5} S T^2 + \\
        1.56 * 10^{-2} Z + 2.55 * 10^{-7} Z^2 - \\
        7.3 * 10^{-12} Z^3 + 1.2 * 10^{-6} Z (lat - 45) -\\ 
        9.5 * 10^{-13} T Z^3 + 3 * 10^{-7} T^2 Z + 1.43 10^{-5} S Z$$

#### Calculating water density  
  Depending on the method used to compute the density contrast of the target to the surrounding fluid, the density rather then the density contrast might be obtained. In order to get the density contrast at ambient conditions, it is important to know the density of the surrounding fluid. Within ZooScat the density of water can be calculated, following formulas found in the Tenth report of the joint panel on oceanographic tables and standards. UNESCO Technical Papers in Marine Science, Paris, 25p [@unesco_tenth_1981].  
  
  Inside DWBAapp, $\rho$ can be computed by clicking on the `Calculate seawater density based on Salinity, Temperature and pressure` link on the `Material properties` tab (located under the Density Contrast input). This will open a new tab in the result pane, where Temperature, Salinity and Pressure can be entered.  
  
  ![*Calculate the density of the external fluid*](calc_rho.png){width=700px align=centre}  

Following the UNESCO Standard, density is calculated in four steps:  
  
  First the density of Standard Mean Ocean Water ($\rho_smow$) with temperature (T) in degree Celsius:
  $$a0 = 999.842594 \\
    a1 = 6.793953 * 10^-2 \\
    a2 = -9.09529 * 10^-3 \\
    a3 = 1.001685 * 10^-4 \\
    a4 = -1.120083 * 10^-6 \\
    a5 = 6.536332 * 10^-9 \\
    \rho_{smow}(T) = a0 + a1 * T + a2 * T^2 + a3 * T^3 + a4 * T^4 + a5 * T^5$$
    
  Density at depth is dependent on the compressibility ($\kappa$):  
  $$ h_0 = 3.2399 \\
    h_1 = 1.43713 * 10^{-3} \\
    h_2 = 1.16092 * 10^{-4} \\
    h_3 = -5.77905 * 10^{-7} \\
    i_0 = 2.838 * 10^{-3} \\
    i_1 = -1.0981 * 10^{-5} \\
    i_2 = -1.6078 * 10^{-6} \\
    j_0 = 1.91075 * 10^{-4} \\
    k_0 = 8.50935 * 10^{-5} \\
    k_1 = -6.12293 * 10^{-6} \\
    k_2 = 5.2787 * 10^{-8} \\
    m_0 = -9.9348 * 10^{-7} \\
    m_1 = 2.0816 * 10^{-8} \\
    m_2 = 9.1697 * 10^{-10} \\
    B_w = k_0 + k_1 T + k_2 T^2 \\
    B_2 = B_w + (m_0 + m_1 T + m_2 T^2) S \\
    A_w = h_0 + h_1 T + h_2 T^2 + h_3 T^3 \\
    A_1 = A_w + (i_0 + i_1 T + i_2T^2) S + j_0 S^{1.5} \\
    K_{p0}(S, T) + A_1 p + B_2 * p^2 $$
  
  Then the density of seawater with Salinity (S in psu +/- ppm) at pressure (p in bar) = 0 is computed ($\rho_0$:  
  
  $$b_0 = 8.2449 * 10^-1 \\
    b_1 = -4.0899 * 10^-3 \\
    b_2 = 7.6438 * 10^-5 \\
    b_3 = -8.2467 * 10^-7 \\
    b_4 = 5.3875 * 10^-9 \\
    c_0 = -5.7246 * 10^-3 \\
    c_1 = 1.0227 * 10^-4 \\
    c_2 = -1.6546 * 10^-6 \\
    d_0 = 4.8314 * 10^-4 \\
    B_1 = b_0 + b_1 T + b_2 T^2 + b_3 T^3 + b_4 T^4 \\
    C_1 = c_0 + c_1 T + c_2 T^2 \\
    \rho_0(S,T)=\rho_{smow}(T) + B_1 S + C_1 * S^{1.5} + d_0 S^2 $$
    
Density at a given pressure is then computed as:  
$$ \rho = \frac{\rho_o(S,T)}{1-\frac{p}{K(S,T)}}$$

#### Getting some example values for g and h  

It is important to only use the DWBA model provided here for low density and soundspeed contrasts (within 5%). This is illustrated in the validation vignette (``). The DWBA performs very well for weak scatters, such as salps, euphausids, copepods, etc. but would perform very poorly if applied to an almost rigid target, such as a target sphere.  
Some of the g and h found in literature are summarised in a table which can be accessed within DWBAapp through clicking on `how/hide some reported material properties ` the first link in the `Material properties` tab. This will open a new tab in the results pane.

#### Generating a body with multiple g and h values  

For more complex scatting targets, the internal g and h compard to the external fluid can be varied.
