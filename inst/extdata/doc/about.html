	<h3>Overview</h3>
	ZooScat is an implementation of the Distorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA) model for the simulation of acoustic scattering by weak scattering targets inside a fluid.<br>
	It includes a shiny web application called DWBAapp for easy model parametrisation and result visualisation as well as the option to run the DWBA model from the command line. Additional functions to compute soundspeed in water, water density and Spherical Bessel functions with their derivatives (as needed in the analytical solution of a weakly scattering sphere, e.g. Neumann and Hankel functions).

	<h3>Available vignettes</h3>
	We are constantly working on new examples and vignettes.<br>
	A list of all currently integrated vignettes can be obtained through:<br>
	<code>vignette(package="ZooScat")</code><br>
	Currently the following vignettes are available:<br>

	<li>A general introduction to the DWBA model, with examples on how to run the DWBA model inside ZooScat from the command <code>vignette("DwbaCommand", package="ZooScat")</code></li>

	<li>A description of the DWBA web application <code>vignette("DWBAapp_vignette", package="ZooScat")</code></li>

	<li>A validation of the model implication within ZooScat through comparison with an analytical solution of the sphere case <code>vignette("CompareToAnalyticalSolution", package="ZooScat"</code></li>

	<li>An a bit more advanced tutorial on how to run multiple DWBA instance in parallel using multiple cores <code>vignette("DWBAParallel", package="ZooScat")</code></li>
	<br>

	All vignettes are stored as html files, located in the vignettes folder within the system package folder, available after installation of ZooScat.<br>
	If you don't know the location of the package folder, this can be obtained through <code>system.file(package="ZooScat")</code>
	It is recommended to open the html files directly in a browser, rather than through the R preview, as formulas and otherfeatures might not be rendered correctly in the R preview window.</li>
